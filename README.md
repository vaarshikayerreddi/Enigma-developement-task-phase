## ðŸ”´Decision Tree Classifier


The model is designed to predict categorical outcomes (such as survival on the Titanic dataset) by learning simple decision rules inferred from data features.

Decision Trees are easy to interpret and visualize, making them an excellent starting point for classification problems.


## Objectives


- Load and clean a dataset

- Train a Decision Tree Classifier

- Visualize the tree and feature importance

- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report


## Technologies Used


- Python 3.x

- pandas â€“ Data manipulation

- numpy â€“ Numerical operations

- scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning tools

- matplotlib / seaborn â€“ Data visualization


## Dataset


Bank Marketing dataset


## project overview


- The model achieves ~88â€“90% accuracy depending on random seed.

- The project focuses on visual clarity rather than feature optimization.

- You can experiment with more features from the dataset to explore complex non-linear patterns.




## ðŸ”´Linear Regression â€“ Linear Classification 

- Overview


This project demonstrates how to use Linear Models â€” specifically Logistic Regression â€” to perform binary classification on the Titanic dataset.
In this project we focus on Linear Classification (Logistic Regression) for binary outcomes, showing how a linear decision boundary can separate survival classes.

## Objectives


- Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset

- Train a Logistic Regression (linear classification) model

- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

- Visualize the decision boundary and feature impact


## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x

- pandas â€“ Data manipulation

- NumPy â€“ Numerical operations

- Matplotlib / Seaborn â€“ Visualization

- scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning (model training, preprocessing, evaluation)


## Dataset

>We use the Titanic dataset


## notes

- Accuracy: ~80%

- Model: Logistic Regression (linear classifier)

- Key Predictors: sex, pclass, and fare

- Output: Decision boundary visualizations for survival prediction
